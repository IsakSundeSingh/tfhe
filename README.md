# TFHE ![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/IsakSundeSingh/tfhe/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

TFHE is a Rust port of the C++ library [TFHE](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe).

## Disclaimer

It is a very rough port and is not idiomatic Rust. Few (or none) of the optimizations of the original library are implemented, such as FFT, however may be added in the future.
